\begin{theorem} 
	The Adém relations hold for Steenrod squares
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We have the diagonal action $\bZ_p \times \bZ_p \circlearrowright S^\infty \times S^\infty$, with quotient isomorphic to $L^\infty \times L^\infty$. Also $\bZ_p \times \bZ_p \circlearrowright X^{\wedge p^2}$ by writing points of $X ^{\wedge p^2}$ as a $p \times p$ matrix and letting the first $\bZ_p$ act on the rows, and the second $\bZ_p$ act on the columns.
	
	Therefore, $\bZ_p \times \bZ_p \circlearrowright S^\infty \times S^\infty \times X^{\wedge p^2}$	with quotient space : = $\Gamma_z X$

	%	The fibers of the projection AzX→L°×L° are ✗^P'
	%	This construction is equivalent to taking so ✗ SO ✗ XP'

	%	i. e. Fake 5° ✗ ( Sox XP )P , identify all points having at least one ✗ coord
	%	equal to Xo , and then one factors out by an action of the wreath product
